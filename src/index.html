        <section data-title="What is mini-tutorial.js?">
            <p>
                Basically your are looking at it right now. <tt>mini-tutorial.js</tt> is a clean
                and simple JavaScript application (consisting of only one class and one style sheet),
                which allows you to create beautiful HTML-based documentation and tutorials
                without much effort. All content is contained in a single HTML file using plain
                and simple HTML markup.
            </p>
            <p>
                The JavaScript part renders a simple Table of Contents, a few navigation links
                at the bottom and makes sure that only one chapter at a time is visible. This
                allows the reader to read the document like a simple book without much scrolling.
                Also this makes larger documents appear not as overwhelming and be easier to
                navigate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally I created <tt>mini-tutorial.js</tt> for
                <a href="https://www.wpvs.de/" target="_blank">my lectures at DHBW Karlsruhe</a>
                when I needed a simple template to create online tutorials for my students. It is,
                if you will, the little sister of my other project
                <tt><a href="https://github.com/DennisSchulmeister/lecture-slides.js" target="_blank">lecture-slides.js</a></tt>,
                which is a full-blown HTML slideshow maker with a twist. As such both projects
                share the same keyboard shortcuts and basic appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                This manual of course has also been written with <tt>mini-tutorial.js</tt>.
                So just by reading some of its chapters you already get a good feeling
                of what <tt>mini-tutorial.js</tt> and how it looks like. But if you like
                you can completely change the looks of your documents by writing your own
                style sheet. With <tt>mini-tutorial.js</tt> you have all the freedom you
                want, because at the end of the day it still is just HTML, CSS and tiny
                little bit of JavaScript.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section data-title="Using the keyboard shortcuts">
            <p>
                Of course you can easily navigate between chapters with your mouse or the
                touchscreen on mobile devices. Software developers however also appreciate
                keyboard shortcuts. So here you are. They shortcuts are the same as for
                <tt>lecture-slides.js</tt>, where I have simply copied the code from:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <kbd>Arrow Left</kbd>: Previous Chapter
                </li>
                <li>
                    <kbd>Arrow Right</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>ENTER</kbd> or <kbd>N</kbd>: Next Chapter
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Go, give it a try!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section data-title="Getting started – Downloading the template">
            <p>
                Getting startet with <tt>mini-tutorial.js</tt> is easy. But the make it
                even easier I have prepared a template project, which you can find on
                GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/DennisSchulmeister/mt-template" target="_blank">mt-template</a>.
                This project contains everything you need to write your own documents:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npm</a> for
                    dependencies and useful tools
                </li>
                <li>
                    It uses the highly recommended <a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank">Parcel JS</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    It contains all needed directories and files (which are very little)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Simply download the template project by clicking
                <b>Clone or download</b> » <b>Download ZIP</b> on the GitHub
                page and extract it anywhere on your computer. The start by
                editing the following files:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b><tt>LICENSE</tt>:</b> Either delete this file or change it the
                    license of your choice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><tt>README.md</tt>:</b> The same as with <tt>LICENSE</tt>. Either
                    delete it, if you don't want to publish the source code anyway, or
                    change it according to your needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><tt>src/index.html</tt>:</b> Put your document content here.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                That's all there is. While working on a document you will finde the following
                commands useful (executing them on the command line from within the project
                directory, of course):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>npm install</code> to install all dependencies
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>npm run start</code> to open a browser for a live preview
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>npm run build</code> build a static version for uploading on a web server
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>npm run watch</code> rebuild after each change without starting a local server
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>npm run clean</code> just clean the dist directory
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When done, build the document and upload the content of the <tt>dist</tt>-directory
                to a web server.
            </p>

        <section data-title="How to add chapters to a document?">
            <p>
                Adding new chapters is easy. Here you can see how the template
                HTML file looks like:
            </p>
            <pre data-gobble>
                <code class="html" data-gobble>
                    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
                        &lt;head&gt;
                            &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;

                                &lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
                                    Catchphrase or subtitle of the document
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;/header&gt;

                            &lt;main&gt;
                                &lt;!-- Table of Contents --&gt;

                                &lt;!-- Document chapters --&gt;
                                &lt;section data-title="First Chapter"&gt;
                                    This is chapter one.
                                &lt;/section&gt;

                                &lt;section data-title="Second Chapter"&gt;
                                    This is chapter two.
                                &lt;/section&gt;

                                &lt;!-- Navigation --&gt;
                                &lt;nav&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;
                            &lt;/main&gt;

                            &lt;!-- Copyright --&gt;

            </pre>
            <p>
                As you can see, each chapter is just a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element
                with a <code>data-title</code> attribute. The title will be shown on the
                Table of Contents and above the chapter's content. Simply add more
                <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements to add new chapters and watch your
                browser automagically reload the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                All other HTML elements can be changed as you wish to apply some chrome.
                Just leave the <code>&lt;section id="toc"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>
                in place to get a Table of Contents and the navigation links.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section data-title="I thought mini-tutorial.js had no dependencies">
            <p>
                Well, it hasn't. If you like you can simply copy the files <tt>mini-slides.js</tt>
                and <tt>themes/white.css</tt> over to your project and create static HTML page
                without any external dependency at all. The template project however uses
                <tt>shelljs</tt> and <tt>parcel-bundler</tt> to provide some minimal cross-platform
                tooling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having <tt>npm</tt> and these two dev-dependencies in place you don't have to duplicate
                the <tt>mini-tutorial.js</tt> code for each and every document. Also you get a live
                preview in your browser with hot-reloading and a minified and pruned JavaScript bundle
                with <tt>mini-tutorial.js</tt> and all other JavaScript libraries you might want to use
                for free.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example consider this document. On the previous page we had a syntax highlighted
                code box. All I had to do was to add <tt>highlight.js</tt> as another dev-dependency
                with <code>npm add --save-dev highlight.js</code> and add change <tt>src/index.js</tt>
                to this:
            </p>
            <pre data-gobble>
                <code class="javascript" data-gobble>
                    import MiniTutorial from "mini-tutorial.js";
                    import mtTheme from "mini-tutorial.js/themes/white.css";

                    import hljs from 'highlight.js/lib/highlight';
                    import hljsLangXML from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/xml';
                    import hljsLangJS from "highlight.js/lib/languages/javascript";
                    import hljsStyle from "highlight.js/styles/atom-one-light.css";

                    window.addEventListener("load", () =&gt; {
                        let mt = new MiniTutorial();
                        mt.start();

                        hljs.registerLanguage("html", hljsLangXML);
                        hljs.registerLanguage("javascript", hljsLangJS);
                        document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(el =&gt; hljs.highlightBlock(el));
                    });
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                By importing <tt>highlight.js</tt> from <tt>src/index.js</tt> Parcel JS takes care
                of the rest. The new library will be included in the final JavaScript bundle and
                all unused parts of it will automatically be stripped. The final bundle will then
                be minified to conserve even more bandwidth. Code listings can then be insterted
                like this (note the <code>data-gobble</code> attribute which eats all leading
                whitespace:)
            </p>
            <pre data-gobble>
                <code class="html" data-gobble>
                    &lt;pre data-gobble&gt;
                        &lt;code class="html" data-gobble&gt;
                            &lt;!-- Insert HTML code here --&gt;
                        &lt;/code&gt;
                    &lt;/pre&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                It's just a tiny bit of tooling which makes a huge impact. Bravo to the Parcel JS
                developers!

        <section data-title="Building more than one document">
            <p>
                If you look closely at <tt>package.json</tt> in the template project,
                you will see that the parcel bundler is called with a <tt>src/*.html</tt>
                glob pattern. This makes it easy to build several projects from the
                same source tree. Simply copy the <tt>src/index.html</tt> file and
                create as many HTML files as you want to build documents.
